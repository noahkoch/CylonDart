CylonDart
=========

CylonHTML written in Dart. So beautiful, we call it 6.


#### What?
CylonDart is the Dart variant of CylonHTML which is originally written in Javascript. CylonHTML is a way to make people a little more comfortable while writing HTML. But just a little. Like I would use this in front of my mom or anything. I mean have some class man.

#### How?
`HTML: <div></div>`
Becomes
`Cylon: []`

<br>

#### How?
`HTML: <ul class="parent"><li>I'm a child!</li>I too am a child!<li></li></ul>`
Becomes
`Cylon: [ul class="parent"\[li\I'm a child!][li\I too am a child!]]`
